PI-Calculator
=============
The aim of this project is to calculate the decimal places of pi. 
This project implemets a loadbalancer in case that one client asks a server to calculate some decimal places of pi 
but this particular server already calculates numbers for another client. In this case the loadbalancer gives the client a 
more or less free server to spread the load.
